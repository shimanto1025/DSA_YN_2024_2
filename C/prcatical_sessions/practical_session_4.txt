1.Write a C program to implement a stack using an array with push and pop operations.
Expected Output:

Elements in the stack are: 3 5 4 3 2 1 


2. Write a C program to implement a stack using a singly linked list.
Expected Output:

 Push data 1
 Push data 2
 Push data 3
 Push data 4

 Pop data: 4
 Pop data: 3
 Pop data: 2
 Pop data: 1

 Check a stack is empty or not?
 Stack is empty!


 4. Write a C program that accepts a string and reverse it using a stack.
Expected Output:

Input a string: w3resource
 Reversed string using a stack is: ecruoser3w


 8. Write a C program to find the next greater element for each element in an array using a stack. Return -1 if there is no next-larger element.
Expected Output:

Elements in the array are: 1 2 3 4 5 6
The next larger elements are:
1 --> 2
2 --> 3
3 --> 4
4 --> 5
5 --> 6
6 --> -1

Elements in the array are: 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
The next larger elements are:
0 --> -1
1 --> -1
2 --> -1
3 --> -1
4 --> -1
5 --> -1
6 --> -1

Elements in the array are: 3 7 5 9 3 2 4 1 4
The next larger elements are:
3 --> 7
5 --> 9
7 --> 9
2 --> 4
3 --> 4
1 --> 4
4 --> -1
9 --> -1


11. Write a C program to find the minimum element in a stack.
Expected Output:

Current stack elements:
9 2 4 2 4 
Minimum element: 2

After removing two elements:
Current stack elements:
9 2 4 
Minimum element: 2

After adding one element:
Current stack elements:
9 2 4 1 
Minimum element: 1

12. Write a C program to find the maximum element in a stack.
Expected Output:

Current stack elements:
5 2 1 6 8 
Maximum element: 8

After removing two elements:
Current stack elements:
5 2 1 
Maximum element: 5

After adding one element:
Current stack elements:
5 2 1 10 
Maximum element: 10


14. Write a C program to calculate the average value of the stack elements.
Expected Output:

Elements of the stack:
6 4 2 5 3 1 
Average of the said stack values: 3.50

Popped value: 6

Elements of the stack:
4 2 5 3 1 
Average of the said stack values: 3.00
