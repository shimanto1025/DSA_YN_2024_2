1. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No


2. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. Create a function that removes an element from the queue.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Delete an element from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 4

3. Write a C program to implement a queue using a linked list. Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No
