1. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No


2. Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. Create a function that removes an element from the queue.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3 

Delete an element from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 2 3 4

3. Write a C program to implement a queue using a linked list. Programs should contain functions for inserting elements into the queue, displaying queue elements, and checking whether the queue is empty or not.
Expected Output:

Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes

Insert some elements into the queue:
1 2 3 

Insert another element into the queue:
1 2 3 4 

Check the queue is empty or not? No



6. Write a C program to reverse the elements of a queue.
Expected Output:

Queue elements are:
1 2 3 4 5
Reverse Queue, elements are:
5 4 3 2 1
Add two elements to the said queue:
Queue elements are:
5 4 3 2 1 100 200
Reverse Queue, elements are:
200 100 1 2 3 4 5



7. Write a C program to calculate the sum of the elements in a queue.
Expected Output:

Queue elements are: 1 2 3 4 5 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 15

Remove 2 elements from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 12

Insert 3 more elements:
Queue elements are: 3 4 5 300 400 500 
Sum of the elements in the queue is: 1212
