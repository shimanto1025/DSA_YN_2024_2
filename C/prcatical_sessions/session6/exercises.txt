1. Implement Queue using linked list
Queue: 10 20 30 40 
Dequeued: 10
Queue: 20 30 40 
Front element: 20
Queue is empty!


Q2: Design a Printer Queue Simulation (Queue with Linked List)
Task: Simulate a printer queue system in a printing department. You are tasked with managing print jobs using a queue. A print job has a document name and the number of pages to print. Implement the queue using a linked list and the following operations:

addJob(): Add a new print job to the queue.
processJob(): Process the next job in the queue (print it and remove it).
viewNextJob(): View the next job to be printed.
isQueueEmpty(): Check if the queue is empty.

q3: Implement a Stack for Undo Functionality (Stack with Array)
Task: Design a system where the user can perform actions (like writing text in a text editor) and undo the last action. Implement the undo functionality using a stack, where each operation is stored in the stack and can be undone by popping from the stack.

performAction(): Record an action.
undoAction(): Undo the last action.
