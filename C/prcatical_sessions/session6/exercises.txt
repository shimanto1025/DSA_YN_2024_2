Q2: Design a Printer Queue Simulation (Queue with Linked List)
Task: Simulate a printer queue system in a printing department. You are tasked with managing print jobs using a queue. A print job has a document name and the number of pages to print. Implement the queue using a linked list and the following operations:

addJob(): Add a new print job to the queue.
processJob(): Process the next job in the queue (print it and remove it).
viewNextJob(): View the next job to be printed.
isQueueEmpty(): Check if the queue is empty.
