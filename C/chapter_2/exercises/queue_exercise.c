/*
Exercise 1: Linear Queue Implementation
Problem: Implement a linear queue using arrays. Your queue should support the following operations:

enqueue(int value): Add an element to the rear of the queue.
dequeue(): Remove an element from the front of the queue.
display(): Display all elements in the queue.
Constraints: Assume a fixed size queue (MAXSIZE = 5).

Exercise 2: Circular Queue Implementation
Problem: Implement a circular queue using arrays. Your queue should support the following operations:

enqueue(int value): Add an element to the rear of the queue.
dequeue(): Remove an element from the front of the queue.
display(): Display all elements in the queue.
Constraints: Assume a fixed size circular queue (MAXSIZE = 5).
